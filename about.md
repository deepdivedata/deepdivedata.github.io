## About


I work primarly in the area of data and visual analytics. I enjoy playing with data, crunch numbers and turn the data to meaningful insights, especially concerning the problems that matter which is indeed one of the reasons why I started exploring data journalism as a hobby. I started this blog to share my thoughts, interesting resources and knowledge. I am a big fan of "what? why? and how?" approach to learning new stuffs so you will find this format in most of my tutorials.   

I am always open to reading your suggestions to further my website so please feel free to comment and write me. 

Enjoy!
