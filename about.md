## About

I work in the area of data and visual analytics. I love playing with data and help people gain meaningful insights, especially, concerning the problems that matter which is indeed one of the key reasons why I started exploring data journalism as a hobby. I started this blog with so much enthusiasm to share what I know and knowledge I gained from other sources, etc., I am open to reading your suggestions so please feel free to comment. Happy Reading:-)

Enjoy!
